    <h1>About me!</h1>
    <p>
      Hi! My name is Kaeleigh Warner and I am a senior at URI double majoring in political science and criminal justice! <br> After college, I plan on looking into paralegal studies and interning at a law firm. <br> In my free time I enjoy spending time with my family and friends, and reading! My favorite genre is mystery/crime.
